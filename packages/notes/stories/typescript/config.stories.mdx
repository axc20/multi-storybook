# tsconfig.json

- configure TS compiler options (`tsconfig.json`) - the compiler will take in TS files and generate JS files
- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html

```shell
yarn add --dev typescript
yarn run tsc --init
```

- TS compiler relies on declaration files to be able to show errors and hints from other packages. A declaration file provides all the type information about a library.
- Two main ways to get declarations for a library:
  - bundled: library bundles its own declaration file - look for an `index.d.ts` file; some libraries will have it specified in their `package.json` under `typings` or `types` field
  - [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) - a repository of declarations for libraries that don't bundle a declaration file
- If package you use doesn't bundle declarations nor are they available on DefinitelyTyped, use a local declaration file (`declarations.d.ts`) in the root of your source directory.

```ts
declare module 'querystring' {
  export function stringify(val: object): string;
  export function parse(val: string): object;
}
```
