# terminal

## command line reference

Windows, macOS - whatever operating system you're using - is simply a visual representation of your computer, known as a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. Take away the file explorer, desktop, icons, and other graphics, and you're left with the command line. Your _entire_ computer can be accessed through the command line.

```shell
# print working directory
pwd

# list directory contents
ls

# clear terminal screen
clear

# change directory
# . represents current directory, .. represents one directory backwards
cd directory
cd .. # go back one directory
# spaces in directory and file names
cd "My Projects" # quotations
cd My\ Projects # escaping

# make directory
mkdir directory

# create new file
touch file

# concatentate - view contents of a file
cat file

# write text to a file
echo "Some Text" > file

# remove
rm file
rm *.png # wild card; delete all png files

# remove directory
rmdir directory
rm -r directory # remove a directory that has files in it

# copy files and directories
cp source destination
cp -R source destination # copy recursively (copy a directory and all its contents)

# duplicating a file
cp file newFile

# moving files and directories
mv source destination

# run multiple commands (&&)
touch newfile.txt && mv newfile.txt websites

# change mode (change permissions)
chmod 644 test.html # 644 - read and write by owner
sudo chmod 775 directory # sudo - super user do
sudo su # switch to the administrator user
exit # return back to regular user account

# connecting to another computer or server
ssh username@host

# display current user id
whoami

# DNS lookup
dig website

# open manual (help) pages
man command # q to quit

# free text editing program
nano file
```

## homebrew

```shell
# homebrew
brew update
brew doctor
brew install some-package
brew uninstall some-package
brew autoremove
brew list # list packages installed by brew
brew leaves # list all top-level packages installed by brew
brew remove --force $(brew list --formula) # uninstall all packages installed by Homebrew
```

## PATH

When you run a command line like `python` or `pip`, your OS searches through a list of directories to find an executable file with that name. This list of directories lives in an environment variable called `PATH`, with each directory in the list separated by a colon.

```shell
echo $PATH
```
